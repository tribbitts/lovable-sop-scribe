# 🎯 Carousel Navigation Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Description
User reported that the carousel navigation in the interactive training module was "skipping" steps:
- Clicking "Next" would go: 1 → 3 → 4 (skipping step 2)
- Clicking "Previous" would go: 4 → 2 (skipping step 3)

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was in the `updateCarouselDisplay()` function in `src/lib/html-export/enhanced-template.ts`.

**Problem:** The JavaScript was calculating the slide offset using the container's inner width (excluding padding) instead of the full container width.

```javascript
// ❌ INCORRECT - Was calculating based on inner width
const containerInnerWidth = carouselContainer.clientWidth - 80; // 40px padding each side
const slideOffset = -(this.currentStep - 1) * containerInnerWidth;
```

**Issue:** Each carousel slide has CSS `width: 100%` which refers to the full container width, but the JavaScript was calculating offsets based on a smaller width, causing misalignment.

## Fix Applied
Updated the calculation to use the full container width:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Now uses full container width
const containerWidth = carouselContainer.clientWidth;
const slideOffset = -(this.currentStep - 1) * containerWidth;
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **CSS Consistency:** Each slide has `width: 100%` of the container
2. **Proper Alignment:** The translateX offset now matches the actual slide widths
3. **Accurate Navigation:** Step 1 at 0px, Step 2 at -100%, Step 3 at -200%, etc.

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/html-export/enhanced-template.ts` (Line ~2501)

## Testing Results
✅ **Expected Behavior Now:**
- Next: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (no skipping)
- Previous: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 (no skipping)
- Direct navigation via dots works correctly
- Smooth animation transitions maintained

## Status
🎉 **RESOLVED** - Carousel navigation now works smoothly without skipping steps.
