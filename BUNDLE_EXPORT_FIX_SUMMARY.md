# üéØ Bundle Export Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Summary
The user was experiencing **"Export Failed - Failed to export SOP as Bundled Training Package"** errors when trying to export bundled training packages. The export showed a success popup but no download occurred.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing Font Files
**Problem:** The enhanced PDF generator was trying to load Inter font files from `/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf` and `/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf` which didn't exist in the public directory.

**Fix:** 
- Created `public/fonts/` directory
- Downloaded Inter Regular and Bold font files from GitHub
- Improved font loading error handling to gracefully fall back to system fonts

### 2. ‚úÖ PDF Generation Auto-Save Issue
**Problem:** The `generateEnhancedPDF` function was calling `pdf.save()` which triggered an unwanted download during bundle generation.

**Fix:** 
- Removed the auto-save call from enhanced PDF generator
- PDF now only returns base64 data for bundle packaging

### 3. ‚úÖ Improved Error Handling & Logging
**Problem:** Silent failures made debugging difficult.

**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive console logging throughout bundle generation
- Added try-catch blocks around PDF and HTML generation steps
- Enhanced error messages with specific failure points

## Files Modified

### Core Bundle Generation
- `src/lib/bundle-generator.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- `src/lib/pdf/enhanced-generator.ts` - Removed auto-save, improved font handling
- `src/lib/pdf/utils.ts` - More resilient font loading

### Public Assets
- `public/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf` - Added Inter font file
- `public/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf` - Added Inter font file
